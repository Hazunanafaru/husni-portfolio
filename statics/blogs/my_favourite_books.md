# My Favourite Books

Here I want to share my favourite books I ever read (at least until 2024). I like read books but not really a bookaholic. Hopefully you can find a new books recomendation after read this article.

## The Rememberance of Earth's Past a.k.a The Three-Body Problem Trilogy

First time I ever heard about this trilogy was when I scrolling Reddit to find books recomendation. I was looking for a Hard Fiction novel that have a unique story and world-building. I found two candidates at those time, The Stromlight Archive series written by Brandon Sanderson and The Rememberance of Earth's Past written by Liu Cixin. I like RPG games with high fantasy settings so The Stromlight Archive serries should be the most advantageous candidate, but during those time I still pursuing my bachelor degree as Nuclear Engineer and have a deep curiousity about how far we can push science fiction. In the end I bought The Three-Body Problem book from Periplus and don't worry I'm currently reading The Way of Kings (first The Stromlight Archive series book) since I have more spare time to read.

The Three-Body Problem start slow. Really slow. I had a mind to drop this book because of the pace in the early book. However, after you found the real problem the main character facing there is no turn back. From there you'll be introduced to several concept in physics, mathematic, and computing that interfaced through a VR game. In the end of the book, you'll see how the main enemy of this trilogy doomed humanity with something I never imagined before. The enemy attacking humanity fundamental weapon that without it we can't make a further move to counter the enemy. It's really facinating when I remeber first time read it. Trully rewarding experience.

The second and third book, The Dark Forest and Death's End took the doomed ending of the first book to the next level. Personally I like the third book most but the second book have several impact in my life personally. I don't want to spoiler you anymore so you can enjoy the mindblowing experience reading this trilogy for the first time.
